W04_06_Tower_Breakers.js

Two players are playing a game of Tower Breakers! Player 1 always moves first, 
and both players always play optimally. The rules of the game are as follows: 
- Initially there are n towers.
- Each tower is of height m. 
- The players move in alternating turns.
- In each turn, a player can choose a tower of height x and reduce its heigh to y, where 1 <= y < x and y evenly divides x.
- If the current player is unable to make a move, they lose the game.

Given the values of n and m, determine which player will win. If the first player wins, return 1. Otherwise, return 2.

Example
n = 2
m = 6

There are 2 towers, each 6 units tall. Player 1 has a choice of two moves: 
- remove 3 pieces from a tower to leave 3 as 6 modulo 3 = 0
- remove 5 pieces to leave 1

Let Player 1 remove 3. Now the towers are 3 and 6 units tall.
Now Player 1 has only one move. 
Player 1 removes 2 pieces leaving 1. Towers are 1 and 2 units tall. 
Player 2 matches again. Towers are both 1 unit tall. 
Player 1 has no move and loses. Return 2.

Function Description
Complete the towerBreakers function in the editor below.
towerBreakers has the following paramter(s):
int n: the number of towers
int m: the height of each tower

Returns
int: the winner of the game

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer t, the number of test cases.
Each of the next t lines describes a test case in the form of 2 space-separated integers, n and m.

Constraints
1 <= t <= 100
1 <= n, m <= 10^6

Sample Input
STDIN   Function
-----   --------
2       t = 2
2 2     n = 2, m = 2
1 4     n = 1, m = 4

Sample Output
2
1

Explanation
We'll refer to player 1 as P1 and player as P2.
In the first test case, P1 chooses one of the two towers and reduces it to 1. 
Then P2 reduces the remaining tower to a height of 1. As both towers now have height 1,
P1 cannot make a move so P2 is the winner. 
In the second test case, there is only one tower of height 4. 
P1 can reduce it to a height of either 1 or 2. P1 chooses 1 as both players always choose optimally. 
Because P2 has no possible move, P1 wins.
